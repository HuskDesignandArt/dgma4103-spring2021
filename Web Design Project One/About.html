<h1>A little more about myself</h1>
<br>

<h3 style="Text-align:center">Who I am</h3>
<p>Hey, my name is Joshua DeWispelaere. I'm Dutch/Irish and i was born in Canandaigua New York. I have a tendency to babble so im gonna organize this.</p>
<hr>
<h4 style="text-align:center">My current main goal</h4>
<p>I've found that I personally feel more motivated and happy in life when i have a goal set in my head, whether it be big, or small. Right now my "Life Goal" is to make stories, whether they be expressed in writing, animation (3d most likely), or film. </p>
<hr>
<h4 style="text-align:center">Why???</h4>
<p>Well,I grew up on such wonders as adventure time, gravity falls, and steven universe. While these shows may not seem similar in most fashions, they do have atleast one thing in common that attracts my interest which is synchronous development between the characters and the viewer. Each of these shows were presented in a way that allowed a child to watch and enjoy the funny jokes, heartwarming moments, and developmental education (although it may be presented childishly). While children could gather all that from these shows they were also recieving something they couldn't even percieve of yet, the ability to grow and change without judgement or ill will.</p>

<h4 style="text-align:center">Ok thats enough talking, I really could go on for a while....</h4>
